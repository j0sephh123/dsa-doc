array basic operations


Work with combinations of elements or specific portions of the array.
Pair and Subarray Operations (e.g., find pairs with sum, subarray sums).

It seems like you’ve covered many fundamental array operations, which are essential for mastering problem-solving techniques. To build on this, you can expand your understanding of arrays by focusing on more advanced topics and common interview patterns. Here’s what you can consider next:

### **Advanced Operations and Concepts**

#### 1. **Sorting Techniques**
   - Explore common sorting algorithms: 
     - Quick Sort
     - Merge Sort
     - Heap Sort
     - Counting Sort (non-comparison based)
   - Use cases: Solving problems efficiently, like finding the kth largest/smallest element or merging intervals.

#### 2. **Binary Search Applications**
   - Beyond searching a single element, solve problems like:
     - Finding the peak element in a mountain array.
     - Finding the first/last occurrence of an element.
     - Solving range queries efficiently.

#### 3. **Two Pointer Technique**
   - Examples:
     - Pair sum (e.g., find two numbers in a sorted array that add up to a target).
     - Remove duplicates in-place from a sorted array.
     - Find triplets that sum to zero.

#### 4. **Partitioning Problems**
   - Rearrange arrays based on a pivot.
   - Example problems:
     - Dutch National Flag Problem.
     - Rearrange array into alternating positive and negative numbers.

### **Special Patterns**

#### 1. **Subarray Problems**
   - Largest subarray with a given sum (using prefix sums or hash maps).
   - Maximum product subarray.
   - Kadane's algorithm for maximum sum subarray.

#### 2. **Merging and Splitting**
   - Merge two sorted arrays without extra space.
   - Split array into subarrays to minimize the largest sum.

#### 3. **Matrix and Multidimensional Arrays**
   - Rotate a matrix (90 degrees, 180 degrees).
   - Spiral traversal of a matrix.
   - Search in a row-wise and column-wise sorted matrix.

### **Optimal Techniques**

#### 1. **Frequency Count Problems**
   - Count the frequency of elements using a hash map.
   - Find the majority element (appears more than n/2 times).

#### 2. **Bucket Sort/Radix Sort Use Cases**
   - Problems like finding the maximum gap between array elements.

#### 3. **Sliding Window with Variations**
   - Fixed size vs. dynamic window size.
   - Problems:
     - Longest substring without repeating characters.
     - Maximum sum subarray of size k.

### **Decision-Making Problems**

#### 1. **Greedy Problems**
   - Minimize operations, such as jumping to the end of an array (minimum jumps problem).
   - Distribute candies or chocolates.

#### 2. **Dynamic Programming with Arrays**
   - Solving the longest increasing subsequence.
   - Solving the coin change problem with arrays.
